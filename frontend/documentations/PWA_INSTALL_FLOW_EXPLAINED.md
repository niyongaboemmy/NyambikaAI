# PWA Install Flow Explained

## 🎯 Overview

The PWA installation feature consists of a **smart banner** that appears automatically and adapts based on the browser's capabilities.

## 📱 The Install Banner ("Get the full experience" popup)

### What is it?

A compact, modern banner that appears in the **bottom-right corner** of the screen:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  📱  Install Nyambika       ✕  │
│      Quick access • Offline     │
│                                 │
│  [Install Now/Get App] [Later] │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Purpose

- **Inform users** the app can be installed
- **Provide easy access** to installation
- **Adapt to browser capabilities** (native vs manual)
- **Non-intrusive** (dismissable, shows after 3 seconds)

## 💡 Understanding the Buttons

### "Install Now" Button

**Meaning**: 
> "I can install this automatically for you!"

**When you see it**:
- Chrome or Edge browser
- PWA criteria met
- `beforeinstallprompt` event fired

**What it does**:
- Triggers native browser installation
- Shows system dialog
- Handles installation automatically

**User benefit**:
- Fastest installation (2 clicks)
- No manual steps needed

---

### "Get App" Button

**Meaning**: 
> "Let me show you how to install this!"

**When you see it**:
- iOS Safari
- Firefox
- Safari Desktop
- PWA criteria not fully met
- Automatic install not available

**What it does**:
- Opens instructions modal
- Shows platform-specific steps
- Guides user through manual process

**User benefit**:
- Clear guidance
- Platform-specific instructions
- No confusion about how to install

---

## 🔧 Customization & Control

### For Users

**Dismiss the banner**:
- Click "Later" button
- Click "×" close button
- Banner won't show again for 7 days

**Manual trigger**:
- Use `InstallAppButton` component
- Available in navigation/header
- Bypasses dismissal timer

**Clear dismissal**:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('pwa-prompt-dismissed')
```

---

### For Developers

**Adjust timing**:
```tsx
<InstallPrompt 
  delay={3000}                    // Show after 3 seconds
  showAfterDismissalDays={7}      // Show again after 7 days
/>
```

**Manual trigger**:
```tsx
<InstallAppButton 
  variant="default"    // or "compact" or "icon-only"
/>
```

**Debug**:
```javascript
debugPWA()  // Check installation criteria
```

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### When to Show Banner

✅ **DO**:
- After user has engaged with site (3+ seconds)
- On return visits if previously dismissed (7+ days)
- When PWA criteria are met

❌ **DON'T**:
- Immediately on page load
- If already installed
- Multiple times in same session
- When user is clearly not interested

### Button Labels

✅ **GOOD**:
- "Install Now" (when automatic)
- "Get App" (when manual)
- "Later" (defer option)

❌ **BAD**:
- "Click here"
- "Download"
- "OK"
- Technical jargon

## 🎓 FAQ

### Q: Why two different buttons?

**A**: Because installation works differently across browsers:
- **Chrome/Edge**: Can install automatically → "Install Now"
- **Others**: Need manual steps → "Get App" (with instructions)

### Q: Why not always show "Install Now"?

**A**: It would be misleading! Users would click it expecting automatic installation, but nothing would happen on browsers that don't support it.

### Q: What's the difference between the banner and InstallAppButton?

**A**: 
- **Banner**: Auto-appears after 3 seconds, dismissable
- **InstallAppButton**: Persistent in navigation, always available

### Q: Can users install on all browsers?

**A**: Yes! 
- **Chrome/Edge**: Automatic one-click install
- **Others**: Manual installation with clear instructions

### Q: Why does the banner disappear?

**A**: To avoid annoying users. If dismissed:
- Won't show again for 7 days
- But `InstallAppButton` is always available
- Users can trigger manually when ready
